# Implementation-of-Multiple-Signal-Classification-algorithm-for-Direction-of-Arrival-Estimation

This project implements an algorithm to estimate the direction of arrivals (DOAs) from multiple targets or sources. In this model, we consider uniform linear arrays. The antenna array receives the signal from multiple sources at multiple angles. The aim is to detect those angles.
The algorithm uses Linear Algebra techniques. Implementation is done in MATLAB.
